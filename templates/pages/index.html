<h2>
  Jake at a Glance
  <br>...
</h2>
<p>
  Jacob, or Jake, a.k.a. Baroquebloke, is a truly unique and highly inteligent
  individual with a fondness for puns and 
  <a href="http://www.ouaismaisbon.ch">bizarre French humor</a>, and speaking 
  about himself in the third person.
</p>
<p>
  When he's not studying code or thinking about tech you can  usually 
  find him reading old scifi, brewing beer, or desiging his off-the-grid tiny
  home and urban farm with his wife.
</p>
<p>
  You can usually tell when he's in a room by the sound of passionate 
  discussions about farm animals:
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<em>"I don't care what other people think, 
    I will have goats one day, damnit!"</em>
