<h2>
	The Lowdown
</h2>
<h2>
	...
</h2>
<p>
	Having done my time in higher education, I decided to start the long and 
  arduous path to recovery.  Along the way, I've developed a great eye for 
  photography, a fondness for good bread, old scifi, and 
  <a href="http://www.ouaismaisbon.ch" class="french" 
    target="_blank">bizarre French humor</a>.  
</p>
<p>
	Next stop?  Embracing my inner nerd.

<h2>
	What Brought Me Here?
</h2>
<h2>
	...
</h2>
<p>
	When I was younger, I fell in love with music.  This proceeded to guide my 
  life for well over a decade, through highschool, a couple years at 
  Florida State University, and finally to Oberlin Conservatory.  
  While there, I met a girl who, unbeknownst to me, would steal me away to
  France and eventually become my wife.
</p>
<p>
	Though we're stateside again, those two years abroad helped me realize that, 
  despite my love for music, performance did not allow me to use my mind in 
  the ways I wanted.  So with the help of my wife, cheap wine, and expensive 
  moldy cheese I made the decision to head in a different direction: 
  programming.
</p>
<p>
	In a way, programming is not unlike music and French combined.  There is 
  still the challenge and excitement of learning a foreign language but also 
  the thrill of creating something beautiful.  
  I've been hooked ever since.
