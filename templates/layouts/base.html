        <h2>Having diligently done my time in higher education in pursuit of
          a music degree, I've decided to finally embrace my inner nerd.  I 
          have always been facinated by computers, technologie, gadgets,
          and mischief. Taking things apart makes me feel like a kid.  Putting 
          things back together again makes me feel like Einstein.  Making 
          things that actually work makes me think I'm Neo.  You know, flying
          around the Matrix and shit...</h2>
